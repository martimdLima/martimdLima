    "bio": "Once an aspiring archeologist who loved digging for archeological remains and now I'm trying to apply what I learned from archeology in my new found passion, Coding. I'm very calm and relaxed, I'm focused, and I can handle stress well. I'm also a very curious person, avid for knowledge. I find fundamental to try to better myself daily by continually learning new things. Learning Programming was a big personal challenge that is leading me to be a top tier Software Developer. The one you are looking for. So if you ever need someone to pick up that dusty code you have and dig the bugs out of it, you know who to call.",
